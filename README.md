## 🚀 Project Overview

LearnMate is an **Agentic AI Coach** designed to help students discover personalized learning paths based on their interests, skill levels, and goals. It dynamically interacts with users to assess their preferences and provides a tailored course roadmap that evolves over time.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

- 📊 Assesses current skill level and learning goals
- 🗺️ Generates dynamic and personalized course roadmaps
- 🔄 Continuously adapts based on user progress and feedback
- 🌐 Provides curated resources and project suggestions

## 🧠 Technologies Used
